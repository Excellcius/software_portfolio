# Overview

This project is a simple program that prints out the phrase "Hello, world!" into the terminal.

I created this project as a reminder of the basics of python coding. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The only tool I used for this project was the IDE of VSCode and the programming language python.
Python is one of the first languages I learned in school and it was a pretty simple user interface, so I figured it was
the most efficient way to make this project.
